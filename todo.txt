look into letting Float being a valid class in the command search hash

show example using aliases to support commas in numbers
/#{word_break}[,\d]+#{word_break}/ => -> (match) { match.tr(',', '') }
or something. that does not validate commas being every 3. maybe:
/(?<=\d),\d\d\d/

look into
Even with existence boolean, this should maybe check that the existing value is not false.
in mongoer.rb, memory.rb might need that too.

consider making it so people can search emoji without quotes.
parse(':)').should == ...
parse('(: smile').should == ...
need to decompose unmatched parens to strings.

show example of it playing friendly with pagination for mongo/memory.

maybe support a real regex type. using that could mean certain things are not needed.

consider only loading chronic if user uses time types

it could be nice to be able to have an alias where the proper name is off limits.

support arrays (and maybe other nesting/relations)

more customizable syntax

interface to plug extensions/backend into.

One potential future feature
would be to be able to specify a certain number of matches. like,
this name field must have the string ":)" 3 times. having
an option to pass though to real regexes might solve this.

it might be good to have a way to tell "collection" types (paren, or, minus)
from other nest types (compare and command) in the ast, to avoid code like
    [:paren, :pipe, :minus].include?(x[:nest_type])

chronic thinks that "2000" means 20:20 today, not year 2000.
for colons, though confusing for compares:
it would be nice if "foo:monday" matched any date on a monday, not just like this monday.

General searches that are numeric need to be specified and included in the command_fields.
making general searches a hash could fix this.

Handling dynamic types in mongo is something to think about.

q2('-(-1 2 -abc)').should == q2('-(-1) -(2) abc') is currently equivalent logically, but not the same exact query .
multiple NORs under same parent can be merged together.
